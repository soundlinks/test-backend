# Backend Developer Test

## Description

Build a RESTful API that can get/create/update/delete user data from a persistence database.

### User Model

```
{
    "id": 42,                       // user ID (unique)
    "address": "221B Baker Street", // user address
    "description": "",              // user description
    "birthday": "",                 // date of birth
    "name": "SH",                   // user name
    "createdAt": ""                 // user created date
}
```

## Requirements

### Functionality

- The API should follow typical RESTful API design pattern.
- The data should be saved in the database.
- Provide proper API document.

### Tech stack

- Use PHP/Node.js and any framework of them.
- Use any database. MySQL is preferred.

### Bonus

- Write clear documentation on how it's designed and how to run the code.
- Provide proper unit test.
- Write good commit messages.
- An online demo will be a big bonus.

## What We Care About

Feel free to use any libraries you would use if this were a real production App, but remember we're interested in your code and the way you solve the problem, not how well you can use a particular library.

We're interested in your method and how you approach the problem just as much as we're interested in the end result.

Here's what you should aim for:

- Good use of current API design best practices.
- Solid testing approach.
- Extensible code.
